/// I've only created this protocol because ARFaceAnchor's initializer is, at this time, unreliable.
/// When I try creating an ARFaceAnchor in my unit tests by initializing it with an ARAnchor, which initializes with an
/// empty matrix, there is a good ( > 20%) chance that it will subsequently crash when running that line.  This allows
/// me to still test relevant behavior despite that.
